### üéØ Icons

Larasonic uses Iconify for icons. Use them in your Vue components:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Icon icon="mdi:account-circle" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { Icon } from "@iconify/vue";
</script>
```

<Tip>Browse available icons at [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)</Tip>

### üß© UI Components

Larasonic leverages shadcn/vue for its UI components, which are styled with TailwindCSS and can be fully customized.

Configuration for shadcn is found in `components.json`

The base styles reside in `resources/css/app.css`
Customize these components to match your brand, and the entire project will reflect those changes.

To install components in a different location than the default, use:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx shadcn-vue@latest add --all
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx shadcn-vue@latest add --all
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn-vue@latest add --all
```

```bash bun
bunx shadcn-vue@latest add --all
```

</CodeGroup>

## üîß Development Tools

### üìù Styling with Laravel Pint and Rector

Larasonic comes with opinionated code styling rules configured for [Laravel Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) and [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) so you don't have to worry about styling and uses all the latest features from PHP 8.3.

Configure Laravel Pint in `pint.json` and Rector in `rector.php` to enforce consistent code styling and formatting.

Run Pint with:

<CodeGroup>

```bash sail
sail composer format
```

```bash php
composer format

# Run Pint Standalone
./vendor/bin/pint

# Run Rector Standalone
./vendor/bin/rector
```

</CodeGroup>

### üîç Static Analysis with PHPStan

Larasonic includes [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static code analysis at the highest level (9). The configuration is in `phpstan.neon`.

Run PHPStan with:

<CodeGroup>

```bash sail
sail composer analyse
```

```bash php
composer analyse

# Run PHPStan Standalone
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```

</CodeGroup>

### üí° IDE Helper (Optional)

<Info>
If you're using PhpStorm with the [Laravel IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13441-laravel-idea) plugin, you can skip this section as the plugin provides superior autocompletion out of the box.
</Info>

Larasonic includes [Laravel IDE Helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) for better IDE support and autocompletion. Generate helper files with:

<CodeGroup>

```bash sail
sail artisan ide-helper:generate
sail artisan ide-helper:models
sail artisan ide-helper:meta
```

```bash php
php artisan ide-helper:generate
php artisan ide-helper:models
php artisan ide-helper:meta
```
