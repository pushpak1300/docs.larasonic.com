## ⚡ Enable Teams

Jetstream includes the Teams feature by default, allowing users to form teams and invite others. Each team has its own resources, and users can switch between teams easily.

Key features:

- **Team Creation**: Create teams from the dashboard.
- **Invitations**: Invite others via email.
- **Team Management**: Assign roles and manage permissions.
- **Switching Teams**: Move between multiple teams effortlessly.

```php
// config/jetstream.php

'features' => [
    Features::teams(['invitations' => true]),
],
```

## ❌ Disable Teams

Don't need the Teams feature? Just comment out or delete the following line in the features array:

```php
// config/jetstream.php

'features' => [
    // Features::teams(['invitations' => true]),
],
```
