Larasonic comes with built-in API capabilities powered by Laravel Sanctum, allowing you to easily create and manage API tokens for authentication. It also includes automatic API documentation generation using Scribe.

## 🔑 API Authentication

Larasonic uses Laravel Sanctum for API authentication. You can generate tokens in two ways:

### Via Web Interface

Visit `/api/tokens` in your browser to manage API tokens (requires appropriate permissions). Here you can:
- Create new tokens with specific abilities
- View existing tokens
- Revoke tokens

### Via API
This is not supported yet. Please let us know if you need this feature in the [roadmap](https://github.com/pushpak1300/Larasonic/discussions/categories/roadmap)

### Using Tokens

Include the token in your API requests:

```bash
curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 1|LMcaJ5gzKz4GwqPN4Yh8lPgQxdEoHq4Sn6g4YXxM" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    https://your-domain.com/api/user
```


<Tip>
For more details on API authentication, check out the [Laravel Sanctum documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum).

## 📚 API Documentation

Larasonic uses Scribe to automatically generate comprehensive API documentation. This includes:

- Interactive API documentation
- Postman collection export
- OpenAPI (Swagger) specification
- Request/response examples

To generate the documentation:

```bash
php artisan scribe:generate
```

The docs will be available at `/docs` by default.

## 🔍 Example Endpoints

Here's a sample API endpoint from the `app/Http/Controllers/ApiUserController.php`:

```php
Route::apiResource('user', ApiUserController::class)->middleware('auth:sanctum');
```
