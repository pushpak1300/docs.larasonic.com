## 🛡️ Overview

Larasonic comes with a powerful admin panel built on [Filament](https://filamentphp.com), giving you a beautiful interface to manage your application.

## 👤 Accessing the Admin Panel

By default, the admin panel is accessible at `/admin` in local environment.
In Production, you need to modify the `canAccessPanel` method in your User model.

```php
public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
{
  return user()->is_admin;
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Create specific admin roles with limited permissions
- Use resource policies to control access
- Add custom validation rules
- Enable audit logging for sensitive operations
