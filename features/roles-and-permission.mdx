# 🔑 Roles & Permissions

Larasonic uses Jetstream's simple RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) implementation. While not as feature-rich as dedicated packages like Spatie Permissions, it provides a straightforward way to manage team-based roles and permissions.

</Tip>

## 🛠️ Current Implementation

Each team member can be assigned a role, and each role has specific permissions. Roles and permissions are defined in `App\Providers\JetstreamServiceProvider`.

```php:app/Providers/JetstreamServiceProvider.php
Jetstream::defaultApiTokenPermissions(['read']);

Jetstream::role('admin', 'Administrator', [
    'create',
    'read',
    'update',
    'delete',
])->description('Administrator users can perform any action.');

Jetstream::role('editor', 'Editor', [
    'read',
    'create',
    'update',
])->description('Editors can read, create and update content.');
```

## ✅ Checking Permissions

You can check permissions using the methods provided by the `HasTeams` trait:

```php
// Check if user has specific permission
$user->hasTeamPermission($team, 'create');

// Get user's role on team
$user->teamRole($team);

// Check if user has specific role
$user->hasTeamRole($team, 'admin');
```

<Note>
The current implementation is suitable for basic team-based permission scenarios. For complex permission requirements, consider implementing a dedicated package like Spatie Permissions.
