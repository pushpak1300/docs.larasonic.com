Larasonic Demo uses [Resend](https://resend.com) as our primary email provider for all transactional emails. Resend offers excellent deliverability and a modern API. 

You're free to use a different provider, check the [Laravel Mail Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/mail) for more options.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=resend
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="you@yourdomain.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxx # Get this from Resend dashboard
```

## 🧪 Testing Emails Locally 

We recommend using [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) for local email testing:

1. Install Mailpit
2. Update your `.env`:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=localhost
MAIL_PORT=1025
```
3. Emails will be caught by Mailpit's interface at `http://localhost:8025`
